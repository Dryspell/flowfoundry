- **Mobile responsiveness** with perfect scores across all device sizes
- **Loading performance** < 1.5s for critical above-the-fold content

## App Router Implementation Patterns

### Data Fetching Strategy
```typescript
// Server Components with async data fetching
async function HomePage() {
  const heroData = await getHeroContent()
  const testimonials = await getTestimonials()
  
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<HeroSkeleton />}>
      <HeroSection data={heroData} />
      <Suspense fallback={<TestimonialsSkeleton />}>
        <TestimonialsSection data={testimonials} />
      </Suspense>
    </Suspense>
  )
}

// Server Actions for form handling
async function submitContactForm(formData: FormData) {
  'use server'
  // Validation, CRM integration, email sending
}
```

  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<ServicesSkeleton />}>
      <ServicesGrid services={services} />
    </Suspense>
  )
}

// Client Components - for interactivity
'use client'
export function ContactForm() {
  return (
    <form action={submitContactAction}>
      {/* Form inputs with client-side validation */}
    </form>
  )
}

// Server Actions - for form handling and mutations
async function submitContactAction(formData: FormData) {
  'use server'
  
  const result = await createLead(formData)
  revalidatePath('/contact')
  
  if (result.success) {
    redirect('/thank-you')
  }
}
```
